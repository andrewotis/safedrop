# encryptkeeper
a tool to encrypt and decrypt data using openpgp keypairs. primarily a password safe, but also contains keypair generator, a secured calendar,  secured notes, and a few other goodies

- written in react
- integrated sense of humor :-)
- initially a keypair is generated, and then data is encrypted and decrypted based on that
- all processing is done locally in a web browser using openpgpjs (no data is ever stored on a server, or sent over the internet)
- the app outputs all data as a JSON file, with an extension of .crypt
- there *WILL* be a react native/mobile version of this coming very soon
